# TrackTrajectories
Code and data for analysis of peaks and plateaus in performance for high school track athletes

The repository includes 4 data sets and 4 .R code files to analyze each data set. Data were gathered from Athletic.net for 4A - 6A high schools in Texas. "clean" data are those for which missing values are imputed or eliminated and the minutes:seconds format has been converted to seconds. Additional columns for the event and gender of runner have also been added.

A manuscript using these data has been submitted for publication. If you use these data, please cite this repository.

# Data sets are 
track1600clean.csv - clean data for 1600m runners 

track800clean.csv - clean data for 800m runners

track400clean.csv - clean data for 400m runners

track200clean.csv - clean data for 200m runners


Some other data sets are created using the code found in the Code directory. These are created for convenience so that it is not necessary to repeat data wrangling steps.
