# TrackTrajectories
Old code and data for analysis of peaks and plateaus in performance for high school track athletes

The repository includes 4 data sets and 4 .R code files to analyze each data set. Data were gathered from Athletic.net for 4A - 6A high schools in Texas. "clean" data are those for which missing values are imputed or eliminated and the minutes:seconds format has been converted to seconds. Additional columns for the event and gender of runner have also been added.

A manuscript using these data has been submitted for publication. If you use these data, please cite this repository.

# Data sets are 
track1600clean.csv - clean data for 1600m runners 

track800clean.csv - clean data for 800m runners

track400clean.csv - clean data for 400m runners

track200clean.csv - clean data for 200m runners
