Code and data for analysis of peaks and plateaus in performance for high school track athletes

The repository includes 4 data sets and 4 .R code files to analyze each data set. Data were gathered from Athletic.net for 4A - 6A high schools in Texas. "clean" data are those for which missing values are imputed or eliminated and the minutes:seconds format has been converted to seconds. Additional columns for the event and gender of runner have also been added.

A manuscript using these data has been submitted for publication. If you use these data, please cite this repository.

Graphics in this folder are from an older version of the paper that has been revised. Please go to the Code, Data, and Graphics folders for revised code, data and graphics.

The folder "Old Files" contains code and graphis from the first version of the paper.
